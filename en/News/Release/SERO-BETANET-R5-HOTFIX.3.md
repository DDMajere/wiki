## Special Instructions for Wallet Users

### 1. How do you decide whether you want to upgrade or not

** This version does not have to be upgraded. If your program has the following conditions, you can try to upgrade this version. **
* Compared with other machines with the same configuration **the mining efficiency is low**.
* The hard disk is old, IO is too weak to **affect synchronization efficiency**.
* After startup, **time to find node** is too long, **synchronization delay** is too long.
* I hope to see **the computing power** on the wallet.

### 2. How to determine if the current wallet and node version are the latest version

* First find and click the wallet's menu item **[About SERO Wallet]**.

  * Windows: in the top menu [**Help**->**About SERO Wallet**]

  * Mac: in the top menu [**Help**->**About SERO Wallet**]

  ![image.png](http://sero-media.s3-website-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/images/201902//277023-011ac37a052914ec.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/400)

* The pop-up dialog box has current wallet version information and node information.

  * For example, in the following example, the wallet version is 0.1.3, while the node version is 0.5.0-beta.r5-hotfix.2, which is lower than the current latest version number.

  * The difference between a wallet and a node is that the wallet is just your interface, and the real mining is the node program, which is gero.

### 3. If you encounter a pop-up menu that prompts you to upgrade

* Is the dialog shown below

  * Miners who **do not want to upgrade** press **[SKIP UPDATE]** on the left.
  * Miners who **want to upgrade** press **[DOWNLOAD NEW VERSION]** on the right.

* There are two points to pay attention to
  * Whether you need to upgrade, refer to the above instructions **[1. Need to upgrade]**.
  * If your wallet **is starting**
    * Clicking "DOWNLOAD NEW VERSION" will immediately download the new gero background.
  * If your wallet **is running**
    * Click upgrade to exit the wallet and start the upgrade process.

### 4. What if there is no pop-up upgrade window and you want to upgrade?

* Check the version number of your current wallet.
* If it is not the current latest version, close and restart the wallet, the upgrade prompt will pop up automatically.
* If the previous step is not successful, you can do the following steps (this is most insurance)
  * Backup keystore files.
  * Uninstall the previous wallet (this step must be done, it may be invalid to overwrite the installation on Windows).
    - Don't worry, uninstalling the wallet will not erase the data and account files.
  * Download and install the latest wallet, the latest node program will be updated after installation.

### 5. How to estimate your own probability of mine a block

* Refer to [how to estimate your own probability of mine a block in solo mode]
