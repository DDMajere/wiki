# What is the Innovation Guide?



The “Innovation Guide” is a WIKI section open to SERO community developers **(Seror)**. All content comes from SERO developers or testers.



## Significance



SERO combines privacy solutions with smart contracts to do a lot of magical and interesting things. As an open source blockchain project, the community's **`SEROR`** are encouraged to use their imagination and creativity to contribute to the application of SERO.



**SERO wants to achieve the following goals through the Innovation Guide:**



* Our users can create many unprecedented ways of use.

* Make a deeper exploration and outlook on some of the internal mechanisms and usage of SERO.

* Gradually build the ecosystem of SERO.



## How to Contribute to the "Innovation Guide"



As long as users who have magical, strange, and interesting ideas in the application or use of SERO, and who have actually tried some, can `Clone` this `WIKI` and submit their own results to our code base through `Pull Request` of `[github.com](http://github.com)`. After approve the review, we will merge it into `master` and choose whether to translate it into a multi-language version.



For each submission we have the following rules:



* The theme can be a interesting `attempt`, a `theme`, a `problem` or a `plan`.

* The content of each submission is complete, that is, it has `motivation`, `process`, `result`.

* If program code is involved in the content, a link to `open source code` should be attached.



If you have any questions, please send an email to [seror@sero.vip](seror@sero.vip) and we promise to respond as soon as possible.
